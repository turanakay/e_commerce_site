# E-commerce-angular

This project is done by group of people of three.

One for back-end (Django)

One for front-end mobile application (Flutter)

One for front-end Web Application (Angular)

I worked as a front-end web application developer.

Project is mainly a replication of an e-commerce application. This repository only includes the web application part of the project which i worked on.

//Login and Registration have some back-end problems. However, i do not have the access to back-end codes to fix the problem.//
